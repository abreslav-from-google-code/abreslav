The \emph{Parallel Filtering Model} (\emph{PFM}) is proposed in paper \cite{Amos:1996} and is suitable to solve NP-complete problems \cite{Amos:1996, Katsanyi:2003}. It defines four basic operations:
\begin{itemize}
	\item $Remove(T, \{s_1, \dots, s_n\})$ removes form multiset $T$ any string which contains at least one occurrence of some string $s_i$;
	\item $Union(\{T_1, \dots, T_n\}, T)$ creates a multiset T which is a nultiset union of $U_i$;
	\item $Copy(T, \{T_1, \dots, T_n\})$ produces a number of copies, $T_i$, of $T$;
	\item $Select(T)$ selects an element of $T$ uniformly at random, if $T$ is empty then \emph{empty} is returned.
\end{itemize}
Original paper \cite{Amos:1996} assumes each of first three operations to be working \emph{in parallel}, so all the basic operations have time complexity $O(1)$. But in the paper \cite{Amos:1997} the same authors correct this assumption and denote $Remove$, $Union$ and $Copy$ as linear operations ($O(n)$). 
Paper \cite{Katsanyi:2003} proposes a \emph{normal form} of molecular program in \emph{PFM}, where operations (we will refer to them as \emph{elementary steps}) work with minimum amount of data:
\begin{itemize}
	\item $Union(T_1, T_2, T)$ produces a union of two multisets, another form of this operation is $Union(T', T)$ where $T'$ is added to $T$ -- this can be implemented as $Union(T, T', T)$,
	\item $Copy(T, T_1, T_2)$ creates two copies of $T$ ($T$ itself is destroyed then because of the nature of laboratory implementation \cite{Amos:1996})\footnote{Paper \cite{Amos:1996} proposes simply splitting a tube into two halves, but this way is not applicable in real practice, because we need to duplicate each strand. Paper \cite{SOME} describe a way to reach real duplication.}, another form this operation is $Copy(T, T')$ where $T'$ receives a copy of $T$ and $T$ remains existing -- this can be implemented as $Copy(T, T, T')$,
	\item $Remove(T, s)$ (where $s$ is a single string) removes all the strings having a substring $s$.
\end{itemize}

Original forms of basic operations are implemented using elementary steps as follows\footnote{Paper \cite{Amos:1997} mention these implementation implicitly, paper \cite{Katsanyi:2003} defines them explicitly but does not consider difficulties of $Copy$ which cause slightly incorrect implementation that therefore does not destroy a proof it is used in.}.

\procedure{$Copy(T_0, \{T_1, ..., T_n\})$}{
\FOR{$i \gets 0$ \TO $n-1$}
  \STATE $Copy(T_{i}, T_{i+1})$ 
\ENDFOR
}

\procedure{$Union(\{T_1, ..., T_n\}, T)$}{
\STATE $Union(T_1, T_2, T)$
\FOR{$i \gets 3$ \TO $n$}
	\STATE $Union(T_i, T)$
\ENDFOR
}

\procedure{$Remove(T, S=\{s_1, ..., s_n\})$}{
\FOR{$i \gets 1$ \TO $n$}
	\STATE $Remove(T, \{s_i\})$
\ENDFOR
}

Time complexity of each of these operations is $O(n)$ \cite{Amos:1997, Katsanyi:2003}.

In \cite{Katsanyi:2003} author uses these linear implementations to analyze complexity of some algorithms for NP-complete problems which results in polynomial estimations like $O(n^3)$ for Hamiltonian circuit problem.

In section \ref{mpfm} we describe proposed parallel implementation of basic operations. In section \ref{algo} we analyze changes in complexity of algorithms for NP-complete problems proposed in \cite{Katsanyi:2003}. The last section \ref{conclusion} gives concluding notes.
