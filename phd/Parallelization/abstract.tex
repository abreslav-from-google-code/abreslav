In this paper we propose an approach which increases DNA computation productivity by performing laboratory operations in parallel. We show that using this approach time complexity of some algorithms implemented in \emph{Parallel Filtering Model} \cite{Amos:1996} may increase from polynomial to logarithmic. We also describe algorithms' complexities with at least three metrics: execution time, number of DNA strands used and total number of laboratory operations performed.
