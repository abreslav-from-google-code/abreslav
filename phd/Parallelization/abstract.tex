In this paper we propose an approach which increases DNA computation productivity by performing laboratory operations in parallel. We show that using this approach time complexity of some algorithms implemented in \emph{Parallel Filtering Model} \cite{Amos:1996} may increase from polynomial to logarithmic. We also examine amount of DNA strands used and number of laboratory equipment (``tubes'') needed for proposed implementation.
