In this paper we propose an approach which increases productivity of DNA computations  by performing laboratory operations in parallel. We consider algorithms implemented in \emph{Parallel Filtering Model} proposed by M.~Amos, A.~ Gibbons and D.~Hodgson. Basic operation of this model can be implemented using parallel laboratory operations. We show that by using this approach time complexity of some algorithms may be increased from polynomial to logarithmic. We also examine amount of DNA strands used and number of laboratory equipment (``tubes'') needed for proposed implementation.
