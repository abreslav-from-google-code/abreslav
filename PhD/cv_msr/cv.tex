	\raggedleft{since 2007}&\hspace{10pt}&PhD student at Mathematics Department, Saint-Petersburg State University of Information Technology, Mechanics and Optics (SPbSU ITMO)\\
	&&Advisor: Prof. Igor Yu. Popov \\
	&&Topic: \textit{Automatically Derived Languages and Applications to DSLs with Aspects}\\
	&&Our goal is to explore the possibilities of, having a description of a DSL,
	  automatic derivation of languages of typed macros (templates) and structural patterns
	  for this DSL. This helps to automate adding support for generic modules and aspects to DSLs. \\

	&&Computer Technology Department, SPbSU ITMO, GPA 4.90/5.0\\
	&&Thesis: \textit{DSL Development Based on Target Meta-models}\\
	&&The main contribution is a language that allows one to declaratively describe an abstract syntax tree (AST) of a 
	  DSL as a view (in terms of Model-View architecture) of its target meta-model. These descriptions are
	  used as inputs for a generator of translators from mechanically created ASTs trees to target models 
	  (including name resolution). \\
