Am
God saves the Queen
E7                Am
but the fate is blind -
C          E7      Am    E7
blind and deaf to me...

Am          G
you think I am,
     Dm             Am
but nothing of the kind -
C       E7    Am
I just wanna be...

Am  Am7 Am    C              G    C
I wanna be an angel of your Magesty
Am  Am7 Am    D  C      G
I wanna be an angel of Thine
Am  Am7 Am   C           G        F
Nobody sees feelings I'm imbueed with
Am      E7  Am
Nobody can find

I hold your hand,
But it is just a fancy,
Just a foolish dream...

There's nobody here,
And even you are leaving me,
(Please, don't do it, don't leave me now!)
Please, I wanna be...
