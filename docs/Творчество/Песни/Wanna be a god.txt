Wanna be a God

            G
Darker parts of the gloomy sky:
   Em
Nobody lives forever, why?
 G                          Am7*
I would like to fly away from here,
  D            
Out of my mind and the atmosphere.
           C              (Em)
Wanna be a god!

Earth is flyn' around yellow Sun,
You and me go out one by one:
So everything for you is clear,
Would you be a food or a volunteer?

Wanna be a god!

If you think you'll become a fool,
On the other hand a brain is cool,
Don't worry, you'll be paid for it:
Nothing will be done and a kick will hit.

Wanna be a god?
