The game is over,
players go to their place,
but He's the Solver.
Have you ever seen his face?

and so highly organized,
his life is long,
he knows a lot, he's very wise...

on
this thing
of what he consist
I do not exist
but somebody's turned me upside down

I'm watching your fist
And if you insist
I could try to change this pour world
somehow
