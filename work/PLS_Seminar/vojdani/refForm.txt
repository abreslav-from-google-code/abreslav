paper).

A general assessment of the paper, pointing out positive and negative
aspects.

Concrete recommendations for improvments (incl. minimal requirements

Other comments.

Typos:

As these type systems are are usually formulated
but it naturally not the only problem

The locations ρx and ρy are consistently correlated with the locks m1 and m2 ,
respectively. --- the picture shows that \rho_y is correlated with m_2 in case of t1 and with m_1 in case of t_2. From the next sentence it follows that the author has probably ment \rho_z instead of \rho_y, but according to the figure, for \rho_z the correlated sets also have an empty intersection.
